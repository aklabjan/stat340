```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data <- read.csv("student-mat.csv")
```

```{r}
grades <- data %>% select(G1,G2,G3)
pairs(grades)
cor(grades)
```
```{r}
lmG1 <- lm(G3~G1,data = grades)
lmG2 <- lm(G3~G2,data = grades)
pc <- prcomp(grades, scale=TRUE)
lm <- lm(grades$G3 ~ pc$x[,1])
summary(lmG1)
summary(lmG2)
summary(lm)
```

```{r}
sum(residuals(lm)^2)
sum(residuals(lmG1)^2)
sum(residuals(lmG2)^2)
```
```{r}
plot(residuals(lm),xlab="Data Entry Index", ylab="Residual of Lm(G3~PC1)")
abline(h=0,col = "red")

```
There seems to be a strong correlation between the grades students had at the beginning of the year, the middle and the end. This was expected from our data. A linear model seems to be appropriate although when looking at the residual graph there are several outliers on the negative end. This is a pattern to further explore.
