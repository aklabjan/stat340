Our data set describes 395 students, their math grades for a given semester, recorded on three occasions, as well as generic and consistent demographic information.
With this data, we created models to answer our statistical question: (1) What variables have an effect on whether a student will drop out or not?
We found that the following variables affected if a student dropped out: Dating, Failed a class, Whether they took extra paid classes for the course subject, Whether they are receiving extra help from the school
We found these four variables affected whether a student dropped out starting with using data transformation by adding a "dropped" and "completed course" column to our dataset.
After data transformation, we then created a model with dropped as response and everything else in our dataset as the explanatory variables to see how this would affect the
drop rate. Finally we then improved the model by using stepwise selection according to the Akaike Information Criterion. We know that this method is the best because ____. 
We did not find as many significant variables as we would have liked and if we investigated further we would we would have increased our small sample size and expanded our 
research to answer other questions such as: How would our findings change if the study was expanded upon? Would different areas of the world have different results?
